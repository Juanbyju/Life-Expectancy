# Life Expectancy Regression Model

## Project Overview
This project analyzes factors influencing life expectancy using linear regression in R. The dataset includes variables such as healthcare spending, education, and economic indicators. The goal is to identify key predictors of life expectancy and build a predictive model.

## Files in the Repository
- `Life_Expectancy_Analysis.Rmd`: R Markdown file containing the code and analysis.
- `Life_Expectancy_Analysis.pdf`: PDF version of the report.
- `life_expectancy_data.csv`: Raw dataset used for the analysis.
- `README.md`: This file.

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Life_Expectancy_Analysis.Rmd` file in RStudio.
3. Install the required R packages.
4. Run the R Markdown file to reproduce the analysis.

## Results
The regression model identified schooling, region, number of infant deaths and economic status as significant predictors of life expectancy. The final model achieved an R-squared value of 0.98.

## Dependencies
- R packages: `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `caret`, `lm`, etc.
